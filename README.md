A project created for beginners by a beginner to practice contributing to open source projects as a tribute to DigitalOceans' Hacktoberfest 2021

## __My Mission Statement...__

 As a student of frontend development, I want to be able to correctly use git and github, so that I contribute to open source projects

 ## __See a need....fill a need...__

 As a teach-myself-coding beginner developer I love the idea of Hactoberfest but find I get quite discouraged when trying to find a project I can actually contribute to. 
There are a fantastic amount of really great projects out there on github that I would love to work with, but either I do not believe I have a high enough skill or just when I find an issue I can do it has already been fixed, or I get confused when looking at the requirements for contributing.

With so many aspiring and self-taught coders out in the world I don’t believe I’m the only one facing this problem so this year I have decided to create a project dedicated for Hacktoberfest that anyone can contribute to regardless of their skills and also without having to spend forever looking through a list of issues for one they feel they can fix.

See the [contributors page](contributing.md) if you want to join in.

 ## __Project Scope...__
 This will be a single page document with an introduction to Hacktoberfest (and sponsors) where contributors create their own “card”.
 Cards can be:
 * Business card (about me)
 * Motivational quote
 * Coding tips

 ## __Acknowledgments__
We would like to offer our appreciation to DigitalOcean and sponsors of Hacktoberfest
